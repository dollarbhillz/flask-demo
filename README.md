# Demo of Flask App

This app is intended to demonstrate a very simple Flask environment using the
base endpoint. Hopefully this will help others stand up Flask envs of their
own. _This is an exercise._

## Required Packages:
- A computer, probably
- Python ( _obviously_ )
- Flask (can be installed through _pip_)
