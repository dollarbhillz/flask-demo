# Demo of Flask App

This app is intended to demonstrate a very simple Flask environment using the
base endpoint. Hopefully this will help others stand up Flask envs of their
own. _This is an exercise._

## Required Packages:
- A computer, probably
- Python ( _obviously_ )
- Flask (can be installed through _pip_)

## How to Run It
- `$ FLASK_APP=flask_app.py flask run`
- That's it.

## Wanna See It In Action?
- Switch to a new terminal window or put it in the background or whatever.
- `$ curl 127.0.0.1:5000`
- Watch the magic.
- You can even view it in your browser in the beautiful HTML I've written!

## Need help installing Flask?
- Get pip (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
- `$ pip install Flask`
- Done. Game, set, and match.
